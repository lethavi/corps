# A clean coded responsive mobile friendly HTML5 website for a fictional web design company. 

## In this project, things which I learn such as:

### 1. New Semantic Elements in HTML5

### 2. Short-hand for style font

** Example:**
```
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
font-size: 15px;
line-height: 1.5;
```

*So, you can use short-hand:*
```
font: 15px/1.5 Arial, Helvetica, san-serif;
```

### 3. { margin: 0; padding: 0; } what is the exact meaning of this?

> The main reason this is used is because sometimes the browser will apply it's default margin/padding to elements, and in a case where you do not want there to be any margin or padding space around an element you will want to define that there is no margin or padding.

### 4. min-height property

> If the content is smaller than the minimum height, the minimum height will be applied.

> If the content is larger than the minimum height, the ```min-height``` property has no effect.

### 5. Responsive use media query
